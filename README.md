nvim-defaults-shim
==================

This plugin configures Vim to behave more like Neovim does by default, as
described in `:help nvim-defaults`. When sourced under Neovim itself, the
plugin does nothing. It is meant to help to achieve consistent behavior when
switching between Vim and Neovim sharing the same `.vimrc`, without unnecessary
clutter.

There are some automated tests to make sure this plugin stays up-to-date after
every Neovim release. Should any differences arise, the build status icon below
shall turn red:

Alternatives
------------

If you don't care about (neo)vim portability, but simply want a curated bundle
of better defaults, you may also want to consider one of the following
solutions:

* [vim-sensible]
* [defaults.vim]
* [vim-better-default]

Installation
------------

Install the plugin using your favorite plugin manager, for example [vim-plug]:
```
Plug 'psliwka/nvim-defaults-shim'
```
